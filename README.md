Problem Statement:
African students often struggle to gain a practical understanding of mathematics and physics concepts in the context of engineering applications, hindering their ability to be successful in their academic pursuits. Current educational resources do not adequately address this need, leaving many students feeling ill-prepared and discouraged. Additionally, the lack of group projects and opportunities for collaborative work hinders their ability to develop communication and teamwork skills, which are crucial for success in the engineering field.


Solution Idea:
To address the challenge of fostering effective collaboration among university students in Africa, we propose the development of a web application that provides a platform for students to view and apply to different engineering projects. The website will feature a range of collaborative tools, including project-sharing features, forums, and messaging capabilities to enable students to engage with one another, encourage each other and share their progress. The app will be designed to be accessible to students across the African continent, with features that support multiple learning styles, and will be specifically tailored to university-level engineering education. By creating a collaborative environment that supports and encourages student participation, the web application will help to build a strong community of future African engineers who are able to work effectively in teams, innovate and solve complex problems together.

Project Scope:
The proposed web application aims to foster effective collaboration among university students in Africa by providing a platform for students to view and apply to different engineering projects. The app will feature collaborative tools such as project-sharing features, forums, and messaging capabilities to enable students to engage with one another, encourage each other and share their progress. The solution is specifically tailored to university-level engineering education and will be accessible to students across the African continent.
During the hackathon, we plan to develop the core functionality of EduTech such as:
Project search: The search functionality should be implemented to allow students to search for engineering projects in different areas.
Home feed: Students should be able to view engineering projects on their home feed, displayed based on their interests and location.
Collaborative tools: The web application should include project-sharing features, forums, and messaging capabilities to enable students to engage with one another, encourage each other and share their progress.
Project applications: Students should be able to apply to engineering projects directly through the web application.
Progress tracking: The web application should allow students to track their progress on engineering projects and share their progress with their peers.
User profiles: Students should have user profiles that will allow them to share information about themselves, their interests, and their skills.

Relevance to Hackathon Theme:
This project would be highly relevant to a hackathon for solving African university student problems. It would address a common issue for engineering students, namely finding and collaborating on projects. By implementing a search functionality for projects, a home feed displaying projects based on interests and location, and collaborative tools such as forums and messaging capabilities, this web application could help African university students connect with one another and find projects that match their skills and interests. Additionally, by allowing students to apply to projects directly through the web application, track their progress, and share their progress with peers, this application could help students stay organized and motivated while working on engineering projects. Finally, user profiles could help students share information about themselves, their interests, and their skills, making it easier for them to find like-minded collaborators. Overall, this project would be a valuable tool for African university students looking to connect with others and work on meaningful engineering projects together.
